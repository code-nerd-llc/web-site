    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm Viktar, a software engineer who's been writing code professionally since 2007 — mostly in the .NET / C# world, mostly for enterprises that need things to actually work at scale.</p>
    <p>These days I split my time between hands-on development and leading engineering teams. I've led groups of up to 15 engineers across time zones, and I still prefer to stay close to the code.</p>
    <p>My sweet spot is the intersection of cloud architecture (Azure, primarily) and backend development. I like making complex systems simpler and slow deployments faster.</p>
    <p>Lately I've been deep in the AI/LLM space — building agentic workflows, integrating large language models into production systems, and designing evaluation pipelines to make sure they actually behave. It's the most interesting engineering problem I've worked on in years.</p>
